A high concentration of airborne particulates (microscopic fragments of matter that can penetrate deep into your lungs) can irritate your throat and airways, exacerbate asthma symptoms, and disrupt your sleep.\n\nParticulates can come from indoor sources of pollutants like smoke, cooking fumes, and even some household cleaners. You should always take care to minimize your exposure to these types of pollutants, and open a window to help with ventilation if necessary.\n\nParticulate pollution can also come from outdoor sources, both natural and artificial. You can check the AirNow website to see if thereâ€™s an air quality advisory for your area at any time. If so, you should follow EPA recommendations, and limit your time spent outdoors.",
